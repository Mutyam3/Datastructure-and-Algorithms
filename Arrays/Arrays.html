                *** Arrays  ***
                   ------- 

                 Array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations.
                 It is one of the most popular and simple datastructures used in programming. 

            ==>   Basic Terminologies of Array :
            
               1. Array Index : In an array, elements are identified by their indexes. 
                                Array index starts from 0. 

               2. Array Element : Elements are items stored in an array and can be accessed by their index. 

               3. Array Length : The Length of an array is determined by the number of elements it can contain. 

            ==> Memory representation of Array : 

                In an array, all the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. 
                So, if we initialize an array, the elements will be allocated sequentially in memory. 
                This allows for efficient access and manipulation of elements. 

                In Python, lists store references to objects, meaning each element in the list points to a memory location 
                where the object is stored. 


            ==> Declaration of Array :

                Arrays can be declared in various ways in deifferent languages :

                In python, all types of lists are created same way.

                arr = []

            ==> Initialization of Array :

                Arrays can be initialized in different ways in different languages. 

                In Python : 

                # This list will store integer type elements
                   
                   arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

                # This list will store character type elements (strings in Python) 

                   arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

                # This list will store float type elements 

                   arr = [1.4, 2.0, 24.0, 5.0,0.0] All float values 

            ==>  Importance of array :

                  int v1 = 10;
                  int v2 = 20;
                  int v3 = 30;
                  int v4 = 40;
                  int v5 = 50; 
                   . 
                   .                                       10 | 20 | 30  | 40 | 50
                   . 
             Multiple variables to store each value   ==>  Single Array to store all values 

            ==> Types of Arrays : 
                
                      Arrays can be classified into two ways : 

                     => on the basis of size 
                     => on the basis of Dimensions 

                ==> Types of Arrays On the basis of Size :

                1. Fixed Sized Arrays 
                2. Dynamic Size Arrays 

                1. Fixed Sized Arrays : 

                       We cannot alter or update the size of this array. Here only a fixed size (i.e te size that is mentioned in square brackets[])
                       of memory will be allocated for storage. 
                       In Case, we don't know the size of the array then if we declare a larger size and store a lesser number of elements 
                       will result in a wastage of memory or we declare a lesser size than the number of elements then we 
                       won't get enough memory to store all the elements. In such cases, static memory is not preferred. 

                     In python : 

                        # create a fixed-size list of length 5, 
                        # initialized with zeros 

                        arr = [0] * 5

                        # Output the fixed-size list
                        print(arr) 

                2. Dynamic Sized Arrays : 

                       The size of the array changes as per user requirements during execution of code so the coders donot have to worry about sizes.
                       They can add and removed the elements as per the need. The memory is mostly dynamically allocated and d-allocated in these arrays.

                       #Dynamic Array : 
                       arr = []

            ==> Types of Arrays on the basis of Dimensions : 

                 1. One-dimensional Array(1-D Array) : You can imagine a 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another. 

                           One -dimensional Array (1-D Array) 

                            index  ==>  0 1  2  3  4  5
                           Element ==>  5 10 20 25 30 35

                 2. Multi-Dimensional Array : A Multi-dimensional array is an array with more than one dimension.
                                            We can use multidimensional array to store complex data in the form of tables.etc.,
                                            We can have 2-D arrays, 3-D arrays, 4-D arrays and so on. 


                           => Two-Dimensional Array(2-D Array or Matrix) : 2-D Multidimensional arrays can be considered as an array of arrays or as a Matrix consisting of rows and columns. 

                           => Three-Dimensional Array(3-D Array) : A 3-D Multidimensional array contains three dimensions, so it can be considered an 
                                                                    array of two-dimensional arrays. 


                        
            ==>  Operations on Array : 

                    1. Array Traversal : Array Traversal refers to the process of accessing and processing each element of an array sequentially. 
                                         This is one of the most fundamental operations in programming, as arrays are widely used data structures for 
                                         storing multiple elements in a single variable. 

                        How Array Traversal Works ? 

                           When an array is created, it occupies a contiguous block of memory where elements are stored in an indexed manner. 
                           Each element can be accessed using its index, which starts from 0 in most programming languages.
                           
                           For Example, consider an array containing five integers : 

                                            arr = [10,20,30,40,50]

                                here : The first element (10) is at index 0.
                                       The second element (20) is at index 1 
                                       The last element (50) is at index 4 

                            Array Traversal means accessing each element from start to end (or sometimes in reverse order), usually by using a loop. 

                        Types of Array Traversal : 

                        Array traversal can be done in multiple ways based on the requirement : 

                        1. Sequential(linear) Traversal :
                             
                                => This is the most common way of traversing an array.
                                => It involves iterating through the array one element at a time from the first index to the last.
                                => Used for printing elements, searching or performing calculations(such as sum or average).

                        2. Reverse Traversal : 

                                => Instead of starting index 0, the traversal begins from the last element and moves towards the first. 
                                => This is useful in cases where we need to process elements from the end. 
                                
                   2. Insertion in Array : 

                        Insertion in array refers to the process of adding a new element at a specific position while maintaining the order of the existing elements 
                        Since arrays have a fixed size in static implementations, inserting an element often requires shifting existing elements to make space. 

                        How Insertion Works in an Array ? 

                        Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, meaning elements are arranged in a sequential block. 
                        When inserting a new element, the following happens : 

                        1. Identify the Position : Determine where the new element should be inserted. 
                        2. Shift Elements :  Move the existing elements one position forward to create space for the new element. 
                        3. Insert the New Element : Place the new value in the correct position 
                        4. Update the Size(if Applicable) : If the array is dynamic, its size is increased. 

                         Example : if we have the array : 
                                        
                                           arr = [10,20,30,40,50]

                         and we want to insert 25 at index 2, the new array will be : 

                                          arr = [10,20,25,30,40,50]

                         here, elements 30,40,50 have shifted right to make space 

                        Types of Insertion : 

                        1. Insertion at the Beginning (Index 0) : 
                            => Every elements must shift one position right 
                            => This is thr least efficient case for large arrays as it affects all elements. 

                        2. Insertion at a Specific Index : 
                            => Elements after the index shift right. 
                            => If the index is in the middle, half of the array moves 

                        3. Insertion at the End : 
                            => The simplest case since no shifting is required
                            => Used in dynamic arrays where size increases automatically (eg.python lists). 

                   3. Deletion in Array : 

                          Deletion in an Array refers to the process of removing an element from a specific position while 
                          maintainingthe order of the remaining elements.
                          Unlike linked lists, where deletion is efficient, removing an element from an array requires shifting elements to fill the gap. 
                          
                          How Deletion works in an Array ? 

                          Since arrays have contiguous memory allocation, deleting an element doesnot reduce the allocated memory size. 
                          Instead, it involves : 

                          1. Identify the Position : Find the index of the element to be deleted. 
                          2. shift Elements :  Move the elements after the deleted element one position to the left.
                          3. Uodate the Size (if applicable) : If using a dynamic array, the size might reduced. 

                          Example, consider the array : 
                                           arr = [10,20,30,40,50]
                                    if we delete the element 30 (index 2), the new array will be : 
                                            arr = [10,20,40,50]

                            here, elements 40 and 50 shifted left to fill the gap. 

                        Types of Deletion : 
                           
                           1. Deletion at the Beginning (Index 0) 
                                => Every Element shifts left by one position. 
                                => This is the most expensive case as it affects all elements. 

                           2. Deletion at a specific Index 
                                => Only elements after the index shift left 
                                => If the index is in the middle, half of the array moves. 
                                
                           3. Deletion at the End 
                                => The simplest case since no shifting is required. 
                                => The size of the array is reduced (in dynamic arrays). 

                    4. Searching in Array : 

                            Searching in an array refers to the process of finding a specific element in a given list of elements 
                            The goal is to determine whether the element exists in the array and, if so, find its index(position).

                            Searching is a fundamental operation in programming, as it is used in data retrieval,filtering and processing.

                            Types of Searching in an Array : 

                            There are two main types of searching techniques in an array : 

                            1. Linear Search (Sequential Search) :

                                => This is the simplest search algorithm 
                                => It traverses the array one element at a time and compares each element with the target value 
                                => If a match is found, the search continues until the end  of the array. 

                                Example : consider an array : 

                                              arr = [10,20,30,40,50]

                                If we search for 30, the algorithm will :

                                1. Compare 10 with 30 => No Match 
                                2. Compare 20 with 30 => No Match 
                                3. Compare 30 with 30 => Match found at index 2. 

                            2. Binay Search (Efficient Search for sorted Array)

                               => Works only on sorted arrays(in increasing or decreasing order)
                               => Uses a divide and conquer approach 
                               => It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target element is found. 

                               How Binary Search Works ? 
                               1. Find the middle element of the array 
                               2. If the target is equal to the middle element, return its index 
                               3. If the target is less than middle element, search the left half 
                               4. If the target is greater than the middle element, search the right half 
                               5. Repeat until the element is found or the search space is empty. 

                                consider a sorted array : 
                                          arr = [10,20,30,40,50]
                                if we search for 30 : 
                                   Middle element = 30 => Match found! 
                                   The search ends in just one step, making it much faster than linear Search.
