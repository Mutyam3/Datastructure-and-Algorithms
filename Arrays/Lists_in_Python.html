            ****    Lists In Python :  ****  
                    --------------- 

            
             In Python, a list is a built-in data structure that can hold an ordered collection of items. 
             Unlike arrays in some languages, Python lists are very flexible :

             => can contain duplicate items 
             => Mutable : items can modified, replaced or removed 
             => Ordered : elements maintain the order in which they were added. 
             => Index-based : items are accessed using their position (starting from 0)
             => Can store mixed data types (integers, strings, booleans, even other lists)

          ==>   Creating a List : 

              Lists can be created in several ways, such as using square brackets, the list() constructor or by repeating elements. 
              
              1. Using Square Brackets :

                        We use square brackets [] to create a list directly.

                        Example : Creating lists with integers, strings and mixed data types. 

                                a = [1,2,3,4,5] # List of Integers 
                                b = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] # List of strings 
                                c = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True] # Mixed data types 
                                print(a)
                                print(b)
                                print(c)


              2. Using list() constructor : 

                         we can also create a list by passing an iterable(like a tuple , string or another list) to the list() function 

                         Example: Creating a list from tuple and string 

                                a = list((1,2,3,'apple', 4.5))
                                print(a) // [1,2,3,'apple',4.5]

                                b = list('Mutyam')
                                print(b) // ['M', 'u', 't', 'y', 'a', 'm']

              3. Creating List with Repeated Elements : 

                         we can use the muliplication operator * to create a list with repeated items. 

                         Example : Creating lists with repeated values.

                         a = [2] * 5 
                         b = [0] * 6 
                         print(a) // [2,2,2,2,2]
                         print(b) // [0,0,0,0,0,0]

          ==> Accessing List Elements : 

                 Elements in a list are accessed using indexing. Pythom indexes start at 0, 
                 so a[0] gives the first element. Negative indexes allow access from the end (e.g., -1 gives the last element)

                     Example : Accessing first, last and slicing elements : 

                     a = [10,20,30,40,50]

                     print(a[0]) // 10
                     print(a[-1]) // 50
                     print(a[1:4]) # Elements from index 1 to 3 // [20,30,40] 

          ==> Adding Elements into List : 

                 We can add elements to a list using the following methods:

                 => append() : Adds an element at the end of the list 
                 => extend() : Adds multiple elements to the end of the list 
                 => insert() : Adds an element at a specific position 
                 => clear()  : removes all items 

                 Example : 

                 a = []

                 a.append(10) // [10]

                 a.insert(0,5) // [5,10]

                 a.extend([15,20,25]) // [5,10,15,20,25]

                 a.clear() // [] 

          ==> Updating Elements into List : 

                  Since Lists are mutable, we can update elements by accessing them via their index. 

                  Example : Updating the second Element 

                  a = [10,20,30,40,50]
                  a[1] = 25 
                  print(a) // [10,25,20,30,40,50]

          ==> Removing Elements from list : 

                  We can remove elements from a list using :

                => remove() : Removes the first occurrence of an element 
                => pop() : Removes the element at a specific index or the last element if no index is specified
                => del statement : Deletes an element at a specific index 

                Example : 

                    a = [10,20,30,40,50]

                    a.remove(30)
                    print(a) // [10,20,40,50]

                    b = a.pop(1)
                    print(b) // 20 
                    print(a) //[10,40,50]

                    del a[0] 
                    print(a) // [40,50]

          ==> Iterating Over lists : 

                 We can iterate over lists using loops, which is useful for performing actions on each item 

                 Example : Iterating with a for loop 

                 a = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

                 for item in a: 
                      print(item) 

                Output : 
                apple 
                banana 
                cherry 

          ==> Nested Lists : 
          
                  A nested list is a list within another list, which is useful for representing matrices or tables 
                  We can access nested elements by chaining indexes. 

                  Example : Accessing elements of a nested list (2D list). 

                          matrix = [ [1,2,3],
                                     [4,5,6],
                                     [7,8,9]
                                    ]
                         print(matrix[1][2]) //6 


          ==> List Comprehension : 

                 List Comprehension is a concise way to create lists using a single line of code. 
                 It is useful for applying an operation or filter to items in an iterable, such as a list or range. 

                 Example : Creating a list of squares using list comprehension 

                     squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,6)]
                     print(squares) // [1,4,9,16,25] 

                 
          ==> How Python Stores List Elements?

                   In Python, a list doesn’t store actual values directly. Instead, it stores references (pointers) to objects in memory. 
                   This means numbers, strings and booleans are separate objects in memory and the list just keeps their addresses.

                   That’s why modifying a mutable element (like another list or dictionary) can change the original object,
                    while immutables remain unaffected.

                          a = [10, 20, "GfG", 40, True]
                          print(a)        
                          print(a[0])     
                          print(a[1])  
                          print(a[2])

                    Output
                       [10, 20, 'GfG', 40, True]
                        10
                        20
                        GfG
                    Explanation:

                        The list a contains an integer (10, 20 and 40), a string ("GfG") and a boolean (True).
                        Elements are accessed using indexing (a[0], a[1], etc.).
                        Each element keeps its original type.
